## Code Explanation

The code for this project is written in JavaScript and uses the React framework. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Importing React and Components**:
   - The first few lines of the code import the React library and the components that will be used in the application.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Header from "./Components/Header/Header";
import Nav from "./Components/Nav/Nav";
import About from "./Components/About/About";
import Experience from "./Components/Experience/Experience";
import Portfolio from "./Components/Portfolio/Portfolio";
import Certificates from "./Components/Certificates/Certificates";
import Contact from "./Components/Contact/Contact";
import Footer from "./Components/Footer/Footer";
```

2. **Creating the `arr` Array**:
   - The `arr` array is created to store the components that will be rendered on the page. Each element in the array represents a component and has an `id` and a `component` property.

```javascript
const arr = [
  {
    id: 1,
    component: Header,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    component: Nav,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    component: About,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    component: Experience,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    component: Portfolio,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    component: Certificates,
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    component
